# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current trading_script.py file has grown to over 3900 lines and has become difficult to maintain, understand, and extend. This refactoring effort aims to break down the monolithic script into well-organized, modular components while preserving all existing functionality and maintaining backward compatibility with existing data files and workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the trading script, I want the code to be organized into logical modules, so that I can easily find and modify specific functionality without navigating through thousands of lines of code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the main trading_script.py SHALL be reduced to under 1000 lines
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN each module SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN related functionality SHALL be grouped together in the same module
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN each module SHALL have clear interfaces and minimal coupling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the trading script, I want all existing functionality to work exactly as before, so that my workflows and data remain intact after the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactored script is run THEN all existing CSV files SHALL be read and written in the same format
2. WHEN the refactored script is run THEN all command-line arguments and environment variables SHALL work identically
3. WHEN the refactored script is run THEN all output formatting and display SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN the refactored script is run THEN all calculations and financial logic SHALL produce identical results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer extending the trading script, I want clear separation between different concerns, so that I can add new features without affecting unrelated functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new market data sources THEN I SHALL only need to modify the market data module
2. WHEN adding new portfolio calculations THEN I SHALL only need to modify the portfolio calculation module
3. WHEN adding new display formats THEN I SHALL only need to modify the display/formatting module
4. WHEN adding new timezone support THEN I SHALL only need to modify the timezone utilities module

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues in the trading script, I want each module to have clear error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify where problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the error message SHALL clearly indicate which module and function caused the issue
2. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN each module SHALL provide detailed logging information
3. WHEN a module fails THEN it SHALL fail gracefully without corrupting data or crashing other modules
4. WHEN importing modules THEN missing dependencies SHALL be handled gracefully with clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with the trading script, I want consistent coding standards and documentation across all modules, so that the codebase is maintainable and understandable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any module THEN it SHALL have comprehensive docstrings for all public functions and classes
2. WHEN reviewing any module THEN it SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and code style
3. WHEN reviewing any module THEN it SHALL have clear type hints for all function parameters and return values
4. WHEN reviewing any module THEN it SHALL have appropriate unit tests for critical functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user running the trading script in different environments, I want the modular structure to handle dependencies gracefully, so that the script works even when optional components are missing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optional dependencies are missing THEN the script SHALL continue to work with reduced functionality
2. WHEN optional dependencies are missing THEN clear warnings SHALL be displayed about what features are unavailable
3. WHEN core dependencies are missing THEN the script SHALL fail with clear instructions on how to install them
4. WHEN running in test mode THEN all modules SHALL support fallback modes for testing without external dependencies
