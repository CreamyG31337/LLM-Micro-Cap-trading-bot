-- FIX RLS SECURITY ISSUES

-- PART 1: ENABLE RLS ON PUBLIC TABLES
-- =====================================================

-- Watched tickers - All authenticated users can read (watchlist is not sensitive)
ALTER TABLE watched_tickers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read watched_tickers" ON watched_tickers
    FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (true);

-- Allow service role full access (for data updates)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage watched_tickers" ON watched_tickers
    FOR ALL
    TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Politicians - Public data, all authenticated users can read
ALTER TABLE politicians ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read politicians" ON politicians
    FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (true);

-- Allow service role full access (for data updates)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage politicians" ON politicians
    FOR ALL
    TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Committees - Public data, all authenticated users can read
ALTER TABLE committees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read committees" ON committees
    FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (true);

-- Allow service role full access (for data updates)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage committees" ON committees
    FOR ALL
    TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Committee assignments - Public data, all authenticated users can read
ALTER TABLE committee_assignments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read committee_assignments" ON committee_assignments
    FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (true);

-- Allow service role full access (for data updates)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage committee_assignments" ON committee_assignments
    FOR ALL
    TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Congress trades - Public data, all authenticated users can read
ALTER TABLE congress_trades ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read congress_trades" ON congress_trades
    FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (true);

-- Allow service role full access (for data updates)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage congress_trades" ON congress_trades
    FOR ALL
    TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Congress trades staging - Admin/service role only (staging data)
ALTER TABLE congress_trades_staging ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Only service role can access staging (admin operations)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage congress_trades_staging" ON congress_trades_staging
    FOR ALL

CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage rss_feeds" ON rss_feeds
    FOR ALL
    TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- =====================================================
-- PART 2: SECURITY DEFINER VIEWS
-- =====================================================
-- These views use SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS for aggregation.
-- This is INTENTIONAL for admin dashboards, but we should document it.
-- 
-- Views that use SECURITY DEFINER:
-- 1. latest_positions - Aggregates portfolio positions across all funds
-- 2. congress_trades_enriched - Enriches congress trades with politician/committee data
-- 3. fund_thesis_with_pillars - Joins fund thesis with related data
-- 4. fund_contributor_summary - Aggregates fund contributor data
-- 5. contributor_ownership - Calculates ownership percentages
--
-- These views are READ-ONLY and designed for admin dashboards.
-- They don't expose sensitive data that RLS should protect beyond
-- what admins already have access to via service_role.
--
-- To remove SECURITY DEFINER warnings, we would need to:
-- 1. Remove SECURITY DEFINER from views (users must have direct table access)
-- 2. Grant broad table permissions to authenticated users
-- 3. This would weaken security, so we keep SECURITY DEFINER
--
-- Alternative: Use service_role client for these views (current approach)
-- =====================================================

-- Add comments to document why SECURITY DEFINER is used
COMMENT ON VIEW latest_positions IS
