Capital: All decisions must be self-funding through rebalancing. Do not assume any new capital infusions.

Re-evaluate All Holdings: Review each current position from the provided data. Is its individual thesis still intact?

Watchlist & New Candidates: Identify 2-3 new, high-quality companies that fit the "Core Dividend" or "Strategic Growth" pillars and are trading at attractive valuations.

Strategic Decisions & Rationale: State your high-level decisions and justify every recommended action (Keep, Add, Trim, Exit, or New Buy).

Forward-Looking View: For the week ahead, identify one key Opportunity and one key Risk for the portfolio.
