Committee Jurisdiction Definitions
===================================

This module defines the "Cheat Sheet" for AI analysis of congressional trades.
Instead of relying on the AI's internal knowledge about committee powers, we inject
explicit descriptions of what each committee regulates.

This is especially important for smaller LLMs (like Granite 8B) that have strong
reasoning capabilities but limited world knowledge.
