# Web Dashboard Fixes Summary - October 4, 2025

## üéØ Issues Fixed Today

### 1. ‚úÖ Fund Performance Graph Normalization
**Issue**: Python graph generator showed fund performance starting "down a bit" while benchmarks correctly started at 100.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `Scripts and CSV Files/Generate_Graph.py` (lines 523-537)
- Added normalization logic to adjust fund performance so first trading day = 0%
- Updated `docs/GRAPH_NORMALIZATION_LOGIC.md` documentation

**Impact**: Fund and benchmarks now have fair, accurate comparison starting from same baseline.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Fund Dropdown Not Working
**Issue**: Selecting a fund from dropdown didn't update dashboard data.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `templates/index.html` initialization logic
- Sequential loading: Load funds first, then other data
- Created separate `reloadDashboardData()` function
- Added console logging for debugging

**Impact**: Dropdown now properly changes displayed data when fund selected.

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Performance Chart Shows "No Data" When Fund Selected
**Issue**: Chart worked without fund selection but showed "no data" with fund selected.

**Root Cause**: `performance_metrics` table in Supabase is empty.

**Solution**: Run `web_dashboard/calculate_real_performance.py` to populate table.

**Status**: Fix documented, user needs to run the script.

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Outdated Plotly CDN Warning
**Issue**: Console warning about using deprecated `plotly-latest.min.js` (stuck at v1.58.5 from 2021).

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `templates/index.html` to use `plotly-2.27.0.min.js`
- Updated `templates/dev_dashboard.html` to use `plotly-2.27.0.min.js`

**Impact**: Removes warning, provides latest Plotly features and improvements.

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Authentication Errors on Vercel (401/403)
**Issue**: Dashboard showed 401 Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden errors on Vercel deployment despite being logged in.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing `credentials: 'include'` in fetch requests (cookies not sent)
- No CORS configuration for cross-origin cookie sharing
- Cookies not configured for HTTPS/cross-origin use

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `credentials: 'include'` to all 17 fetch() calls across 4 HTML templates
- Added Flask-CORS with proper configuration for Vercel domain
- Updated cookie settings: `secure=True`, `samesite='None'` for production
- Auto-detects production vs local environment

**Impact**: Authentication now works on Vercel deployment, cookies properly shared cross-origin.

**Documentation**: See `AUTH_CORS_FIX_SUMMARY.md` for complete technical details.

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Immediate Testing:
1. **Restart web dashboard** to load updated code
2. **Open browser console** (F12) to verify:
   - No Plotly warning
   - "Initializing dashboard..." appears
   - "Dashboard initialized successfully" appears
3. **Test dropdown**:
   - Select different funds
   - Verify "Fund changed to: [name]" in console
   - Verify data updates

### Required Action:
Run this command to populate performance_metrics table:
```bash
cd web_dashboard
python calculate_real_performance.py
```

### Full Testing:
Follow the complete checklist in `web_dashboard/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Install Flask-CORS** for local development:
   ```powershell
   cd web_dashboard
   pip install Flask-CORS
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel** to test authentication fixes:
   - Commit and push changes to Git
   - Vercel will auto-deploy
   - Test login at `https://webdashboard-hazel.vercel.app/auth`

3. **Populate performance_metrics table** for chart to work with fund selection:
   ```powershell
   cd web_dashboard
   python calculate_real_performance.py
   ```

4. **Monitor for any new issues** using the testing checklist

5. **Consider the investigation priorities** listed in `WEB_DASHBOARD_BUGS.md`:
   - Audit all web dashboard API endpoints
   - Automate performance metrics population
   - Add integration tests for fund filtering

## üìä Investigation Summary

### Data Analysis Completed:
- **September 2nd spike**: Confirmed legitimate trading activity (ATYR position increase)
- **September 3rd movement**: Portfolio actually went UP, not down
- **September 4th pullback**: Normal market volatility after spike

### Bugs Identified:
- Graph normalization issue (fixed)
- Fund dropdown issue (fixed)
- Performance chart data source issue (documented, requires data population)
- Plotly CDN warning (fixed)

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Race Conditions Matter**: Async initialization order is critical
2. **Separate Init from Reload**: Don't mix one-time setup with refresh logic
3. **Data Consistency is Key**: Empty tables cause silent failures
4. **Version Pinning**: Always use explicit versions for CDN dependencies
5. **Console Logging Helps**: Debug logs make troubleshooting much easier

---

## üìù Maintenance Notes

- **Plotly Version**: Currently using 2.27.0 - check https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases for updates
- **Performance Metrics**: Needs periodic population when new portfolio data added
- **Testing**: Run full testing checklist before any deployment
