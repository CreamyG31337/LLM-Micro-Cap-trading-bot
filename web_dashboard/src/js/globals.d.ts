/**
 * Global type declarations for browser globals
 * These are shared across all TypeScript files
 * 
 * ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a TypeScript declaration file.
 * - Edit this file: web_dashboard/src/js/globals.d.ts
 * - This file is automatically included by TypeScript
 * - DO NOT edit compiled .js files - they will be overwritten
 * 
 * NOTE: TypeScript compiles ALL files together, even though only one page
 * loads at runtime. This is why we centralize global declarations here.
