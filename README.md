## How the Trading Script Works

### Market Hours & CSV Updates
- **Market Hours**: 6:30 AM - 1:00 PM PST (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST)
- **CSV Updates**: Only occur during market hours and once per day
- **Price Display**: Always shows current prices (even after hours) but doesn't save them
- **New Stocks**: Only added to CSV when market is open, with Action = "BUY"

### Portfolio Management
- **One Row Per Day**: Each stock gets one row per day in the CSV
- **No Duplicates**: Script skips stocks that already exist for today
- **Historical Data**: Preserves all historical prices for graphing
- **Action Tracking**: Automatically sets Action = "BUY" for new stocks
- **Weekend Handling**: Portfolio rebuild automatically skips weekends (Saturday/Sunday) when adding HOLD entries since no market data is available

### Usage
1. **Run anytime**: Script works 24/7 for viewing data and managing portfolio
2. **Market hours**: CSV gets updated with current prices and new stocks
3. **After hours**: Shows prices but doesn't save to CSV
4. **Graphing**: Use the CSV data to generate portfolio performance charts

*For performance data and results, see the CSV files in `trading_data/prod/` and `trading_data/dev/` folders.*

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Market Hours**: Uses most recent close during market hours, 4 PM close after hours
- **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance primary, Stooq fallback for reliability
- **Timezone**: PST with flexible configuration options
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to "N/A" when insufficient data

### FIFO Lot Tracking System
**FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** lot tracking for industry-standard P&L calculation:

- **Method**: Oldest shares sold first (industry standard)
- **Benefits**: Tax advantages, accurate P&L tracking, audit trail
- **Portfolio Display**: Shows both unrealized P&L (current positions) and realized P&L (sold positions)
- **Example**: Buy 100 @ $100, then 100 @ $120, sell 100 @ $130 â†’ Sells first lot, realized P&L = $3,000

### Portfolio Display Formatting
The portfolio snapshot table is optimized for standard display environments:

- **Target Resolution**: 1920x1080 with 125% scaling (Windows 11) - ~157 character terminal width
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different terminal sizes and capabilities
- **Column Optimization**: Daily P&L and Stop Loss columns balanced for readability
- **Color Coding**: Green for gains, red for losses, with clear visual indicators
- **Rich Formatting**: Beautiful tables with Rich library, graceful fallback to plain text

## Debug Tools

The repository includes comprehensive debugging tools in the `debug/` folder:

- **`daily_pnl_debug.py`** - Analyzes daily P&L calculation issues and data availability
- **`market_hours_analysis.py`** - Tests market hours handling and compares with industry standards
- **`price_debug.py`** - General price data debugging and validation

- **`rebuild_portfolio_from_scratch.py`** - Complete portfolio rebuild from trade log with weekend handling

These tools help ensure the trading system operates correctly and provide transparency into how calculations are performed.

### Portfolio Rebuild System

The `rebuild_portfolio_from_scratch.py` script provides a complete portfolio reconstruction system that can fix data inconsistencies and recover from corruption.

**What It Does:**
- **Complete Recreation**: Rebuilds the entire portfolio CSV from scratch using only the trade log
- **Chronological Processing**: Processes all trades in chronological order to ensure accuracy
- **Full Recalculation**: Recalculates all positions, cost basis, and P&L from first principles
- **HOLD Entry Generation**: Creates HOLD entries for price tracking between trades
- **Data Validation**: Ensures all calculations are consistent and accurate

**When to Use:**
- Portfolio CSV is corrupted or has inconsistent data
- Need to recover from a backup or data loss situation
- Want to verify that all calculations are mathematically correct
- Adding new features that require a fresh portfolio structure
- Debugging portfolio display or calculation issues

**Technical Features:**
- **Price Caching**: Uses PriceCache with MarketDataFetcher to minimize API calls and improve performance

- **FIFO Implementation**: Implements proper FIFO lot tracking for accurate P&L calculations
- **Weekend Handling**: Automatically skips weekends when adding HOLD entries (no market data)
- **Error Recovery**: Gracefully handles missing price data and API failures

**Usage:**
```bash
# From main menu (option 'r')
python run.py

# Direct execution with different data directories
python debug/rebuild_portfolio_from_scratch.py trading_data/dev
python debug/rebuild_portfolio_from_scratch.py "my trading" "US/Pacific"
```

## Fund Management System

The trading bot includes a comprehensive fund management system for tracking multiple contributors and their ownership percentages.

### **How It Works**
- **Contributions**: Each $1 contributed = 1 share. Ownership percentage = (your shares / total shares) Ã— 100%
- **Withdrawals**: Reduces your share count. Other contributors' ownership increases to maintain 100% total
- **Fair Performance Sharing**: All contributors benefit equally from fund performance regardless of when they joined
- **Protection**: Cannot withdraw more than your equity value

### **Managing Contributions & Withdrawals**

When you run the trading script, you'll see options for fund management:

```
Fund Management Options:
c - Add fund contribution
w - Process fund withdrawal
o - Show ownership percentages
```

### **Adding Contributions**
1. Select `c` from the main menu
2. Enter contributor name
3. Enter contribution amount
4. Add optional notes
5. The system automatically updates ownership percentages

### **Processing Withdrawals**
1. Select `w` from the main menu
2. Enter contributor name
3. Enter withdrawal amount
4. The system validates the withdrawal against their equity
5. If valid, processes the withdrawal and updates ownership

### **Viewing Ownership**
- Select `o` from the main menu to see current ownership percentages
- Ownership is calculated in real-time based on contributions
- Percentages always total exactly 100%

## System Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Internet connection for market data
- ~10MB storage for CSV data files
