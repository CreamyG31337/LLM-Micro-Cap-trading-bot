- **Debug Tools** - Comprehensive analysis scripts for troubleshooting price data and P&L calculations

## Daily P&L Calculation Design

The system implements industry-standard daily P&L calculation with robust market hours handling:

### **How It Works**
- **Data Source**: Fetches 5 days of historical price data to ensure sufficient data for calculations
- **Calculation Method**: Compares current day's closing price vs previous day's closing price
- **Market Hours Handling**: 
  - **During Market Hours**: Uses most recent close price (updates throughout the day)
  - **After Hours**: Uses 4 PM close price vs previous day's close
  - **Pre-Market**: Uses previous day's close (appropriate for pre-market scenarios)
  - **Weekends/Holidays**: Uses last trading day's close vs previous trading day's close

### **Industry Standards Compliance**
âœ… **Follows standard industry practices:**
- Uses close-to-close price comparison for daily P&L
- Handles different market scenarios appropriately
- Provides consistent calculations regardless of when the script is run
- Matches major trading platforms' daily P&L calculations

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Date Range**: Expands trading day window by 5 days to ensure sufficient historical data
- **Fallback Handling**: Multiple data sources (Yahoo Finance â†’ Stooq) for reliability
- **Configurable Timezone Support**: Handles PST timezone with flexible configuration options
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to "N/A" when insufficient data is available

## Debug Tools

The repository includes comprehensive debugging tools in the `debug/` folder:

- **`daily_pnl_debug.py`** - Analyzes daily P&L calculation issues and data availability
- **`market_hours_analysis.py`** - Tests market hours handling and compares with industry standards
- **`price_debug.py`** - General price data debugging and validation
- **`comprehensive_price_debug.py`** - Advanced price data analysis and troubleshooting

These tools help ensure the trading system operates correctly and provide transparency into how calculations are performed.
