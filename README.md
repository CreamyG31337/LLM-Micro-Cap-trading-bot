- **Debug Tools** - Comprehensive analysis scripts for troubleshooting price data and P&L calculations

## Daily P&L Calculation Design

The system implements industry-standard daily P&L calculation with robust market hours handling:

### **How It Works**
- **Data Source**: Fetches 5 days of historical price data to ensure sufficient data for calculations
- **Calculation Method**: Compares current day's closing price vs previous day's closing price
- **Market Hours Handling**: 
  - **During Market Hours**: Uses most recent close price (updates throughout the day)
  - **After Hours**: Uses 4 PM close price vs previous day's close
  - **Pre-Market**: Uses previous day's close (appropriate for pre-market scenarios)
  - **Weekends/Holidays**: Uses last trading day's close vs previous trading day's close

### **Industry Standards Compliance**
âœ… **Follows standard industry practices:**
- Uses close-to-close price comparison for daily P&L
- Handles different market scenarios appropriately
- Provides consistent calculations regardless of when the script is run
- Matches major trading platforms' daily P&L calculations

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Date Range**: Expands trading day window by 5 days to ensure sufficient historical data
- **Fallback Handling**: Multiple data sources (Yahoo Finance â†’ Stooq) for reliability
- **Configurable Timezone Support**: Handles PST timezone with flexible configuration options
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to "N/A" when insufficient data is available

## Debug Tools

The repository includes comprehensive debugging tools in the `debug/` folder:

- **`daily_pnl_debug.py`** - Analyzes daily P&L calculation issues and data availability
- **`market_hours_analysis.py`** - Tests market hours handling and compares with industry standards
- **`price_debug.py`** - General price data debugging and validation
- **`comprehensive_price_debug.py`** - Advanced price data analysis and troubleshooting

These tools help ensure the trading system operates correctly and provide transparency into how calculations are performed.

## Recent Enhancements & Improvements

*The following enhancements have been added to the original project to improve functionality and user experience:*

### ðŸš€ **Major Features Added**

#### **Dual Currency Support (CAD/USD)**
- **Manual Cash Balance Updates** - Added functionality to manually update cash balances in both CAD and USD
- **Enhanced Fund Management** - Improved fund contribution tracking and sync functionality
- **Currency-Aware Trading** - Trading system now properly handles both Canadian and US markets

#### **Daily P&L Calculation System**
- **Industry-Standard Implementation** - Fixed daily P&L showing "N/A" by implementing proper close-to-close calculations
- **Market Hours Handling** - Robust handling of pre-market, market hours, after-hours, and weekend scenarios
- **Configurable Timezone Support** - PST timezone with flexible configuration options

#### **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Terminal Width Detection** - Automatic terminal resizing and display optimization
- **Virtual Environment Checks** - Automatic venv activation in test scripts
- **Interactive Menu System** - Improved user interaction and display formatting
- **Color-Coded Output** - Enhanced prompt generation with color formatting

#### **Portfolio Management Improvements**
- **Real-Time Price Integration** - Current prices and P&L percentages in portfolio tables
- **Enhanced Data Handling** - Improved DataFrame operations and error handling
- **Portfolio Snapshot Display** - Better visualization of current holdings and performance
- **Ticker Correction Logic** - Streamlined ticker suffix handling and validation

#### **Development Tools & Debugging**
- **Comprehensive Debug Suite** - Multiple specialized debugging scripts
- **Variable Scoping Checks** - Enhanced development tools for code quality
- **Error Handling** - Improved logging and error management throughout the system
- **Data Source Reliability** - Yahoo Finance primary with Stooq fallback for robust data fetching

#### **Fund Management & Ownership System**
- **Fair Shares-Based Ownership** - Each dollar contributed equals one share for proportional ownership
- **Dynamic Ownership Calculation** - Real-time ownership percentages that always total 100%
- **Contribution Tracking** - Complete history of all fund contributions and withdrawals
- **Withdrawal Protection** - Prevents over-withdrawal beyond contributor's equity value
- **Proportional Liquidation** - Withdrawals are funded from overall fund performance, not individual positions
- **Ownership Redistribution** - When someone withdraws, remaining contributors' ownership increases proportionally

**How It Works:**
- **Contributions**: Each $1 contributed = 1 share. Ownership percentage = (your shares / total shares) Ã— 100%
- **Withdrawals**: Reduces your share count. Other contributors' ownership increases to maintain 100% total
- **Fair Performance Sharing**: All contributors benefit equally from fund performance regardless of when they joined
- **Example**: If 10 people each contribute $100 (1,000 shares total) and fund grows 10x, someone contributing $100 later gets 100/1,100 = 9.09% ownership (fair!)

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements**
- **Requirements Updates** - Updated library dependencies and added UI enhancements
- **Code Refactoring** - Streamlined ticker correction logic and removed redundant files
- **Documentation** - Enhanced terminal display guidance and system documentation
- **Experiment Timeline Integration** - Timeline features integrated into prompt generation

## System Requirements
- Python  3.11+
- Internet connection for market data
- ~10MB storage for CSV data files
