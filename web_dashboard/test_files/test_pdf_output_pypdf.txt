The  GBA1  Bridge:  Unlocking  Disease  
Modification
 
in
 
Parkinson’s
 
Through
 
the
 
Lens
 
of
 
Gaucher’s
 
Disease
 
–
 
An
 
Exhaustive
 
Analysis
 
of
 
Gain
 
Therapeutics
 
(GANX)
 
and
 
GT-02287
 1.  Introduction:  The  Convergence  of  Lysosomal  
Biology
 
and
 
Neurodegeneration
 
The  pharmaceutical  industry’s  pursuit  of  a  disease-modifying  therapy  for  Parkinson’s  disease  
(PD)
 
has
 
been
 
characterized
 
by
 
a
 
sequence
 
of
 
high-profile
 
failures,
 
primarily
 
targeting
 
the
 
aggregation
 
of
 
alpha-synuclein
 
or
 
the
 
symptomatic
 
replenishment
 
of
 
dopamine.
 
However,
 
a
 
paradigm
 
shift
 
has
 
occurred
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
decade,
 
redirecting
 
focus
 
toward
 
the
 
upstream
 
genetic
 
and
 
lysosomal
 
drivers
 
of
 
the
 
disease.
 
At
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
this
 
shift
 
is
 
the
 
GBA1
 
gene,
 
which
 
encodes
 
the
 
lysosomal
 
enzyme
 
glucocerebrosidase
 
(GCase).
 
While
 
historically
 
the
 
province
 
of
 
Gaucher’s
 
disease—a
 
rare
 
lysosomal
 
storage
 
disorder—mutations
 
in
 
GBA1
 
are
 
now
 
recognized
 
as
 
the
 
single
 
most
 
common
 
genetic
 
risk
 
factor
 
for
 
Parkinson’s
 
disease.
 
This  report  provides  a  comprehensive,  expert-level  analysis  of  Gain  Therapeutics  (Nasdaq:  
GANX),
 
a
 
clinical-stage
 
biotechnology
 
company
 
that
 
stands
 
at
 
the
 
forefront
 
of
 
this
 
therapeutic
 
pivot.
 
By
 
leveraging
 
a
 
proprietary
 
computational
 
platform
 
to
 
discover
 
allosteric
 
binding
 
sites,
 
Gain
 
has
 
developed
 
GT-02287,
 
a
 
brain-penetrant
 
small
 
molecule
 
designed
 
to
 
restore
 
GCase
 
function.
 
Unlike
 
previous
 
attempts
 
that
 
failed
 
to
 
translate
 
(such
 
as
 
Sanofi’s
 
venglustat),
 
GT-02287
 
employs
 
a
 
mechanism
 
of
 
allosteric
 
restoration
 
rather
 
than
 
substrate
 
inhibition,
 
a
 
distinction
 
that
 
recent
 
clinical
 
data
 
suggests
 
is
 
critical
 
for
 
success.
 
As  of  early  January  2026,  Gain  Therapeutics  has  generated  pivotal  Phase  1b  data  
demonstrating
 
the
 
reduction
 
of
 
the
 
toxic
 
lipid
 
substrate
 
glucosylsphingosine
 
(GluSph)
 
in
 
the
 
cerebrospinal
 
fluid
 
(CSF)
 
of
 
Parkinson’s
 
patients.
1
 This  finding  represents  the  first  clinical  
validation
 
of
 
GCase
 
modulation
 
in
 
the
 
CNS
 
and
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
direct
 
answer
 
to
 
the
 
question
 
posed
 
by
 
the
 
user:
 
What
 
can
 
Gaucher’s
 
disease
 
teach
 
us
 
about
 
treating
 
Parkinson’s?
 
The
 
answer
 
lies
 
in
 
the
 
biomarkers.
 
Just
 
as
 
GluSph
 
reduction
 
predicts
 
clinical
 
benefit
 
in
 
systemic
 
Gaucher’s,
 
Gain
 
posits
 
it
 
will
 
predict
 
neuroprotection
 
in
 
Parkinson’s.
 
This  analysis  dissects  the  molecular  mechanisms,  clinical  evidence,  competitive  landscape,  
and
 
financial
 
standing
 
of
 
Gain
 
Therapeutics,
 
arguing
 
that
 
the
 
company’s
 
"Gaucher-informed"
 
strategy  may  finally  breach  the  blood-brain  barrier  of  neurodegenerative  therapeutic  failure.  
2.  The  Historical  Context:  The  Gaucher’s  Disease  
Paradigm
 
To  understand  the  trajectory  of  Gain  Therapeutics,  one  must  first  deeply  examine  the  history  
of
 
Gaucher’s
 
disease
 
(GD).
 
This
 
history
 
provides
 
the
 
roadmap—and
 
the
 
warning
 
signs—for
 
the
 
current
 
GBA1-PD
 
development
 
landscape.
 
2.1  The  Lysosomal  Storage  Foundation  
Gaucher’s  disease  is  an  autosomal  recessive  disorder  caused  by  biallelic  mutations  in  the  
GBA1
 
gene.
 
These
 
mutations
 
result
 
in
 
the
 
synthesis
 
of
 
a
 
misfolded,
 
catalytic-deficient
 
GCase
 
enzyme.
 
Consequently,
 
the
 
enzyme’s
 
substrates—glucosylceramide
 
(GlcCer)
 
and
 
its
 
deacylated
 
form,
 
glucosylsphingosine
 
(GluSph)—accumulate
 
within
 
the
 
lysosomes
 
of
 
macrophages.
2
 These  "Gaucher  cells"  engorge  and  accumulate  in  the  spleen,  liver,  and  bone  
marrow,
 
causing
 
the
 
classic
 
symptoms
 
of
 
Type
 
1
 
GD:
 
hepatosplenomegaly,
 
anemia,
 
thrombocytopenia,
 
and
 
bone
 
crises.
3  
The  treatment  of  Type  1  GD  is  one  of  modern  medicine’s  great  success  stories.  The  
development
 
of
 
Enzyme
 
Replacement
 
Therapy
 
(ERT)
 
demonstrated
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
restore
 
the
 
enzymatic
 
activity
 
(even
 
partially),
 
you
 
can
 
clear
 
the
 
substrate
 
and
 
reverse
 
the
 
symptoms.
 
However,
 
ERT
 
molecules
 
are
 
large
 
proteins
 
that
 
cannot
 
cross
 
the
 
blood-brain
 
barrier
 
(BBB).
 
Consequently,
 
while
 
Type
 
1
 
patients
 
live
 
near-normal
 
lives,
 
patients
 
with
 
Type
 
2
 
(acute
 
neuronopathic)
 
and
 
Type
 
3
 
(chronic
 
neuronopathic)
 
GD
 
suffer
 
from
 
relentless,
 
untreatable
 
neurological
 
decline.
4  
2.2  The  Clinical  Bridge  to  Parkinson’s  
The  connection  between  GD  and  PD  was  serendipitous.  Clinicians  treating  Gaucher’s  patients  
noted
 
a
 
disproportionately
 
high
 
incidence
 
of
 
Parkinsonism
 
in
 
their
 
patients'
 
relatives—specifically,
 
parents
 
who
 
were
 
heterozygous
 
carriers
 
of
 
the
 
GBA1
 
mutation.
6
 This  
observation,
 
now
 
validated
 
by
 
massive
 
genetic
 
studies,
 
established
 
that
 
even
 
a
 
single
 
mutated
 
allele
 
(resulting
 
in
 
~50%
 
GCase
 
activity)
 
is
 
sufficient
 
to
 
significantly
 
increase
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
PD.
 
Current  estimates  suggest  that  5-10%  of  the  general  PD  population  carries  a  GBA1  mutation,  
with
 
prevalence
 
rising
 
to
 
30%
 
in
 
Ashkenazi
 
Jewish
 
cohorts.
7
 Furthermore,  the  phenotype  of  
GBA-PD
 
is
 
distinct:
 
it
 
is
 
characterized
 
by
 
an
 
earlier
 
age
 
of
 
onset,
 
more
 
rapid
 
cognitive
 
decline,
 
and
 
a
 
more
 
aggressive
 
motor
 
progression
 
compared
 
to
 
idiopathic
 
PD.
8  
2.3  The  Failure  of  Current  Gaucher  Treatments  in  CNS  
The  crucial  lesson  from  Gaucher’s  disease  for  the  Parkinson’s  field  is  the  limitation  of  current  
modalities.
 ●  Enzyme  Replacement  Therapy  (ERT):  While  transformative  for  systemic  disease,  
recombinant
 
enzymes
 
(e.g.,
 
cerezyme)
 
are
 
too
 
large
 
to
 
penetrate
 
the
 
CNS.
 
They
 
do
 
not
 
arrest
 
neurological
 
progression
 
in
 
Type
 
2/3
 
GD
 
or
 
GBA-PD.
5  
●  Substrate  Reduction  Therapy  (SRT):  Drugs  like  miglustat  and  eliglustat  inhibit  
glucosylceramide
 
synthase
 
(GCS).
 
While
 
eliglustat
 
is
 
effective
 
peripherally,
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
cross
 
the
 
BBB.
 
Miglustat
 
does
 
cross
 
the
 
BBB
 
but
 
has
 
failed
 
to
 
show
 
definitive
 
neurological
 
benefit
 
and
 
carries
 
significant
 
side
 
effects.
9  
This  history  sets  the  stage  for  Gain  Therapeutics.  The  "Gaucher  Lesson"  is  that  systemic  
clearance
 
is
 
insufficient;
 
the
 
therapy
 
must
 
penetrate
 
the
 
brain.
 
Furthermore,
 
the
 
failure
 
of
 
older
 
SRTs
 
suggests
 
that
 
simple
 
inhibition
 
is
 
not
 
enough—restoration
 
of
 
the
 
enzyme’s
 
non-catalytic
 
functions
 
may
 
be
 
required.
 
3.  Molecular  Mechanism:  The  GBA1-Alpha-Synuclein  
Feedback
 
Loop
 
The  biological  rationale  for  GT-02287  is  predicated  on  breaking  the  "vicious  cycle"  between  
GCase
 
deficiency
 
and
 
alpha-synuclein
 
aggregation.
 
Understanding
 
this
 
cycle
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
appreciating
 
why
 
allosteric
 
modulation
 
is
 
superior
 
to
 
other
 
approaches.
 
3.1  The  Feed-Forward  Pathology  
In  a  healthy  neuron,  GCase  localizes  to  the  lysosome  to  hydrolyze  GlcCer  and  GluSph.  In  
GBA-PD,
 
this
 
process
 
is
 
disrupted,
 
triggering
 
a
 
cascade
 
of
 
cellular
 
failures:
 1.  Loss  of  Lysosomal  Function:  The  reduction  in  GCase  activity  leads  to  the  accumulation  
of
 
lipid
 
substrates.
 
GlcCer
 
and
 
GluSph
 
are
 
not
 
inert;
 
they
 
stabilize
 
toxic,
 
soluble
 
oligomeric
 
forms
 
of
 
alpha-synuclein.
10
 This  promotes  the  aggregation  of  alpha-synuclein  
into
 
insoluble
 
fibrils
 
(Lewy
 
bodies),
 
the
 
pathological
 
hallmark
 
of
 
PD.
 2.  ER  Stress  and  Trafficking  Blockade:  Mutant  GCase  often  misfolds  in  the  Endoplasmic  
Reticulum
 
(ER).
 
The
 
cell’s
 
Quality
 
Control
 
machinery
 
(ERAD)
 
recognizes
 
this
 
misfolding
 
and
 
targets
 
the
 
protein
 
for
 
degradation.
 
This
 
traps
 
the
 
enzyme
 
in
 
the
 
ER,
 
preventing
 
it
 
from
 
reaching
 
the
 
lysosome.
11
 The  accumulation  of  unfolded  protein  triggers  the  
Unfolded
 
Protein
 
Response
 
(UPR),
 
a
 
cellular
 
stress
 
pathway
 
that
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
apoptosis
 
(cell
 
death).
12  
3.  Secondary  GCase  Deficiency:  Crucially,  aggregated  alpha-synuclein  interferes  with  the  
trafficking
 
of
 
wild-type
 
GCase.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
even
 
in
 
patients
 
without
 
a
 
GBA1
 
mutation
 
(idiopathic
 
PD),
 
the
 
GCase
 
levels
 
in
 
the
 
lysosome
 
are
 
often
 
depleted.
 
This
 
establishes
 
GCase
 
restoration
 
as
 
a
 
viable
 
target
 
for
 
the
 
broader
 
PD
 
population,
 
not
 
just
 
mutation
 
carriers.
3  
3.2  The  Mitochondrial  Axis:  A  New  Dimension  
Recent  research,  underscored  by  Gain’s  presentations  at  Neuroscience  2025,  has  added  a  
third
 
dimension:
 
mitochondria.
 
Wild-type
 
GCase
 
has
 
been
 
found
 
to
 
traffic
 
to
 
the
 
mitochondria,
 
where
 
it
 
is
 
essential
 
for
 
maintaining
 
the
 
integrity
 
of
 
Complex
 
I
 
of
 
the
 
electron
 
transport
 
chain.
12  
●  The  Defect:  In  GBA-PD,  the  failure  of  GCase  to  reach  the  mitochondria  results  in  
mitochondrial
 
dysfunction,
 
energy
 
deficits,
 
and
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
reactive
 
oxygen
 
species
 
(ROS).
 ●  The  GT-02287  Effect:  Preclinical  data  shows  that  GT-02287  facilitates  the  trafficking  of  
GCase
 
to
 
both
 
the
 
lysosome
 
and
 
the
 
mitochondria.
12
 This  dual-organelle  restoration  is  a  
significant
 
differentiator
 
from
 
therapies
 
that
 
only
 
address
 
lysosomal
 
lipid
 
clearance
 
(like
 
SRT).
 
3.3  Glucosylsphingosine  (GluSph):  The  Toxic  Driver  
Within  this  cascade,  GluSph  has  emerged  as  the  critical  pathological  agonist.  Unlike  GlcCer,  
which
 
is
 
a
 
structural
 
lipid,
 
GluSph
 
is
 
a
 
lysolipid
 
with
 
detergent-like
 
properties.
 
●  Toxicity:  GluSph  directly  promotes  alpha-synuclein  aggregation.
10  
●  Biomarker  Validity:  In  Gaucher’s  disease,  plasma  GluSph  is  the  standard  biomarker  for  
monitoring
 
disease
 
activity.
 
Gain
 
Therapeutics
 
has
 
pioneered
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
CSF
 
GluSph
 
as
 
a
 
biomarker
 
for
 
Parkinson’s.
 
Although
 
some
 
historical
 
debates
 
questioned
 
its
 
utility
 
in
 
heterozygotes
 
14
,  recent  high-sensitivity  assays  have  confirmed  its  elevation  in  GBA-PD  
and
 
its
 
correlation
 
with
 
disease
 
severity.
15  
●  Implication:  Reducing  CSF  GluSph  is  not  just  a  biochemical  parlor  trick;  it  is  the  removal  
of
 
a
 
direct
 
neurotoxin.
 
4.  Gain  Therapeutics’  Technology:  The  SEE-Tx®  /  
Magellan™
 
Platform
 
Gain  Therapeutics  distinguishes  itself  from  competitors  through  its  origin  story.  The  company  
did
 
not
 
start
 
with
 
a
 
biological
 
hypothesis
 
and
 
screen
 
a
 
library;
 
it
 
started
 
with
 
physics.
 
4.1  Computational  Discovery  vs.  High-Throughput  Screening  
Traditional  drug  discovery  often  relies  on  High-Throughput  Screening  (HTS),  testing  millions  of  
compounds
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
sticks
 
to
 
the
 
active
 
site.
 
This
 
is
 
inefficient
 
for
 
enzymes
 
like
 
GCase,
 
where
 
binding
 
the
 
active
 
site
 
usually
 
inhibits
 
the
 
enzyme.
 
Gain  utilizes  its  SEE-Tx®  (Site-directed  Enzyme  Enhancement  Therapy)  system,  now  part  
of
 
the
 
Magellan™
 
platform
.
 
This
 
technology
 
leverages
 
the
 
3D
 
crystal
 
structure
 
of
 
proteins
 
and
 
supercomputer-powered
 
physics
 
models
 
to
 
identify
 
"allosteric"
 
pockets—hidden
 
binding
 
sites
 
on
 
the
 
protein’s
 
surface
 
that
 
are
 
distinct
 
from
 
the
 
active
 
site.
2  
4.2  The  Mechanism  of  Allosteric  Regulation  (STARs)  
Gain  calls  its  molecules  Structurally  Targeted  Allosteric  Regulators  (STARs) .  The  
mechanism
 
of
 
GT-02287
 
works
 
as
 
follows:
 1.  Binding:  The  molecule  binds  to  a  uniquely  identifiable  allosteric  pocket  on  the  GCase  
enzyme.
18  
2.  Stabilization:  This  binding  event  rigidifies  the  enzyme,  stabilizing  its  3D  structure.  3.  Chaperoning:  By  correcting  the  misfolding  in  the  ER,  the  molecule  allows  the  enzyme  to  
escape
 
the
 
ERAD
 
quality
 
control
 
system.
 4.  Trafficking:  The  stabilized  enzyme  is  successfully  trafficked  through  the  Golgi  apparatus  
to
 
the
 
lysosome.
 5.  Activity:  Because  the  drug  is  bound  to  an  allosteric  site,  the  active  site  remains  open.  
Unlike
 
competitive
 
chaperones
 
(like
 
Ambroxol)
 
which
 
must
 
dissociate
 
to
 
allow
 
the
 
enzyme
 
to
 
work,
 
GT-02287-bound
 
GCase
 
is
 
fully
 
functional
 
immediately
 
upon
 
arrival.
19  
This  mechanism  addresses  the  fundamental  limitation  of  competitive  chaperones,  which  
require
 
a
 
"Goldilocks"
 
affinity—strong
 
enough
 
to
 
fold
 
the
 
protein,
 
but
 
weak
 
enough
 
to
 
let
 
go
 
in
 
the
 
lysosome.
 
GT-02287
 
bypasses
 
this
 
paradox
 
entirely.
 
5.  Preclinical  Validation:  Building  the  Case  
Before  entering  human  trials,  GT-02287  generated  a  robust  preclinical  dossier  that  validated  
its
 
ability
 
to
 
intervene
 
at
 
every
 
stage
 
of
 
the
 
GBA-PD
 
pathology.
 
5.1  In  Vitro  Efficacy  (iPSC  Models)  
In  collaboration  with  the  University  of  Maryland  School  of  Medicine,  Gain  tested  GT-02287  in  
induced
 
pluripotent
 
stem
 
cells
 
(iPSCs)
 
derived
 
from
 
patients
 
with
 
Gaucher
 
Type
 
2
 
and
 
Type
 
3
 
(neuronopathic
 
forms).
21  
●  Enzyme  Levels:  The  drug  significantly  increased  GCase  protein  levels  and  lysosomal  
localization.
 ●  Substrate  Clearance:  GT-02287  reduced  toxic  GlcCer  by  42.9%  and  50.2%  in  different  
lines.
21  
●  Alpha-Synuclein:  In  dopaminergic  neurons,  the  drug  reduced  the  levels  of  
phosphorylated
 
and
 
aggregated
 
alpha-synuclein,
 
the
 
specific
 
species
 
found
 
in
 
Lewy
 
bodies.
21  
5.2  In  Vivo  Efficacy  (Animal  Models)  
Gain  employed  multiple  rodent  models  to  demonstrate  functional  recovery:  ●  The  CBE  Model:  Rats  treated  with  conduritol-B-epoxide  (CBE),  an  irreversible  GCase  
inhibitor,
 
develop
 
PD-like
 
symptoms.
 
GT-02287
 
administration
 
improved
 
motor
 
function
 
and
 
cognition
 
in
 
this
 
model.
19  
●  Alpha-Synuclein  Transgenic  Mice:  In  mice  overexpressing  human  alpha-synuclein,  
GT-02287
 
reduced
 
alpha-synuclein
 
pathology
 
and
 
neuroinflammation
 
(microglial
 
activation
 
markers
 
Iba-1
 
and
 
GFAP).
22  
●  Neuroprotection:  A  critical  finding  was  the  reduction  of  plasma  Neurofilament  Light  
Chain
 
(NfL),
 
a
 
non-specific
 
but
 
highly
 
validated
 
marker
 
of
 
neuronal
 
injury.
 
This
 
suggests
 
that
 
the
 
drug
 
is
 
not
 
just
 
masking
 
symptoms
 
but
 
preventing
 
the
 
death
 
of
 
neurons.
23  
6.  Competitive  Landscape:  The  Specter  of  Failure  and  
the
 
Opportunity
 
To  evaluate  Gain’s  potential,  one  must  rigorously  analyze  the  competitive  landscape.  The  field  
is
 
littered
 
with
 
failures,
 
most
 
notably
 
Sanofi’s
 
venglustat.
 
Understanding
 
why
 
competitors
 
failed
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
understanding
 
why
 
Gain
 
might
 
succeed.
 
6.1  The  Autopsy  of  Sanofi’s  Venglustat  
Sanofi’s  venglustat  was  the  lead  asset  in  the  GBA-PD  space  for  years.  It  was  a  Substrate  
Reduction
 
Therapy
 
(SRT)
 
designed
 
to
 
inhibit
 
Glucosylceramide
 
Synthase
 
(GCS).
 
The
 
hypothesis
 
was
 
simple:
 
if
 
GCase
 
is
 
broken,
 
reduce
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
the
 
substrate
 
(GlcCer)
 
to
 
prevent
 
buildup.
24  
The  Failure:  In  2021,  the  Phase  2  MOVES-PD  trial  was  halted.  Venglustat  met  its  target  engagement  
endpoint
 
(it
 
lowered
 
GlcCer)
 
but
 
failed
 
the
 
primary
 
clinical
 
endpoint
 
(MDS-UPDRS).
 
More
 
alarmingly,
 
patients
 
on
 
the
 
drug
 
performed
 
worse
 
than
 
those
 
on
 
placebo.25
 Why  did  it  fail?  (The  Second-Order  Analysis)  1.  Lipid  Homeostasis  vs.  Depletion:  By  inhibiting  synthesis,  venglustat  reduced  all  
downstream
 
glycosphingolipids,
 
including
 
gangliosides
 
essential
 
for
 
neuronal
 
membrane
 
health.
 
The
 
trial
 
failure
 
suggests
 
that
 
depriving
 
the
 
brain
 
of
 
these
 
lipids
 
is
 
toxic.
27  
2.  Ignoring  the  Protein:  Venglustat  did  nothing  to  fix  the  mutant  GCase  enzyme  trapped  in  
the
 
ER.
 
The
 
ER
 
stress
 
and
 
UPR
 
caused
 
by
 
the
 
misfolded
 
protein
 
likely
 
continued
 
unabated.
 
Gain’s
 
GT-02287,
 
by
 
chaperoning
 
the
 
protein,
 
resolves
 
this
 
ER
 
stress.
28  
3.  Wrong  Target:  Venglustat  targeted  GlcCer.  Gain  targets  the  enzyme  itself  and  reduces  
GluSph.
 
The
 
specific
 
toxicity
 
of
 
GluSph
 
(the
 
detergent-like
 
lipid)
 
and
 
its
 
interaction
 
with
 
alpha-synuclein
 
suggests
 
that
 
restoring
 
the
 
catabolic
 
pathway
 
(breaking
 
lipids
 
down)
 
is
 
biologically  superior  to  inhibiting  the  anabolic  pathway  (stopping  lipid  creation).  
6.2  Bial  (BIA  28-6156)  
Bial  (formerly  Lysosomal  Therapeutics  Inc.)  is  developing  BIA  28-6156,  an  allosteric  activator .  ●  Mechanism:  It  binds  to  GCase  and  increases  its  catalytic  rate.  ●  Status:  Phase  2  (ACTIVATE)  ongoing;  expected  completion  2026.
29  
●  Comparison:  While  similar  to  Gain,  an  "activator"  primarily  boosts  the  function  of  the  
enzyme
 
molecules
 
that
 
reach
 
the
 
lysosome.
 
Gain’s
 
"stabilizer"
 
increases
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
molecules
 
that
 
reach
 
the
 
lysosome
 
by
 
rescuing
 
them
 
from
 
the
 
ER.
 
Gain
 
argues
 
this
 
"trafficking"
 
effect
 
is
 
the
 
more
 
potent
 
driver
 
of
 
total
 
lysosomal
 
activity.
28  
6.3  Prevail  Therapeutics  (Gene  Therapy)  
Prevail  (Eli  Lilly)  is  developing  PR001,  an  AAV9-based  gene  therapy  delivering  a  functional  
GBA1
 
gene.
 
●  Status:  Phase  1/2.
31  
●  Pros:  Potential  one-time  cure.  ●  Cons:  Invasive  (intra-cisterna  magna  injection),  high  cost,  and  irreversible.  As  a  small  
molecule,
 
GT-02287
 
offers
 
oral
 
dosing
 
and
 
titratability,
 
a
 
significant
 
advantage
 
for
 
a
 
slowly
 
progressive
 
disease
 
where
 
safety
 
is
 
paramount.
32  
6.4  Roche  (Prasinezumab)  
Roche  targets  downstream  alpha-synuclein  with  a  monoclonal  antibody.  ●  Status:  Phase  2b  (PADOVA)  showed  modest  signals  but  failed  to  arrest  progression  
significantly.
33  
●  Implication:  Targeting  extracellular  alpha-synuclein  (antibodies)  may  be  too  late  in  the  
cascade.
 
Gain’s
 
approach
 
prevents
 
the
 
formation
 
of
 
aggregates
 
intracellularly,
 
potentially
 
offering
 
greater
 
efficacy.

7.  Clinical  Development:  Phase  1  Data  and  The  Phase  
1b
 
Breakthrough
 
Gain  Therapeutics  is  currently  executing  a  clinical  development  plan  that  culminates  in  the  
Phase
 
1b
 
trial
 
results
 
released
 
in
 
late
 
2025.
 
This
 
data
 
forms
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
investment
 
thesis.
 
7.1  Phase  1:  Healthy  Volunteers  
The  Phase  1  Single  Ascending  Dose  (SAD)  and  Multiple  Ascending  Dose  (MAD)  studies  
established
 
the
 
baseline
 
safety
 
and
 
PK
 
profile.
 ●  Safety:  The  drug  was  safe  and  well-tolerated  at  all  doses.  ●  Pharmacokinetics:  GT-02287  showed  excellent  oral  bioavailability  and,  critically,  
confirmed
 
CNS
 
penetration.
 
CSF
 
levels
 
were
 
within
 
the
 
projected
 
therapeutic
 
range
 
derived
 
from
 
animal
 
models.
26  
●  Target  Engagement:  In  healthy  volunteers,  the  drug  increased  GCase  activity  in  the  
blood,
 
proving
 
it
 
binds
 
and
 
stabilizes
 
the
 
enzyme
 
in
 
humans.
26  
7.2  Phase  1b:  Parkinson’s  Patients  (The  Pivot  Point)  
This  trial,  fully  enrolled  as  of  Q2  2025,  included  approximately  21  patients  with  
mild-to-moderate
 
PD.
 
Importantly,
 
the
 
trial
 
enrolled
 
both
 
GBA1
 
mutation
 
carriers
 
and
 
idiopathic
 
PD
 
patients.
1  
Trial  Design:  ●  Dosing:  90  days  of  oral  GT-02287.  ●  Extension:  An  open-label  extension  follows  the  double-blind  period,  with  data  expected  
through
 
2026.
 ●  Endpoints:  Safety  (primary),  Biomarkers  (GluSph,  Alpha-synuclein,  NfL),  and  Clinical  
(MDS-UPDRS).
 
The  December  2025  Results:  On  December  18,  2025,  Gain  announced  "positive  results  in  a  key  exploratory  endpoint".1  ●  The  Finding:  GT-02287  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  CSF  
Glucosylsphingosine
 
(GluSph)
.
 ●  Magnitude:  Patients  with  elevated  baseline  GluSph  saw  levels  return  toward  the  range  
observed
 
in
 
healthy
 
individuals.
 ●  Significance:  This  is  the  first  time  any  GCase  modulator  has  achieved  GluSph  reduction  
in
 
the
 
CSF
 
of
 
PD
 
patients.
 
It
 
confirms
 
that
 
the
 
drug
 
is
 
biologically
 
active
 
in
 
the
 
human
 
CNS
 
and
 
is
 
successfully
 
restoring
 
lysosomal
 
function.

this

translating
 
into

8.  The  Biomarker  Thesis:  What  Gaucher’s  Teaches  Us  
The  user’s  query  explicitly  asked  about  the  lessons  from  Gaucher’s  disease.  The  Phase  1b  
data
 
represents
 
the
 
application
 
of
 
those
 
lessons.
 
In  the  development  of  drugs  for  Gaucher’s  disease,  regulatory  approval  was  not  based  on  
"how
 
the
 
patient
 
feels"
 
initially,
 
but
 
on
 
objective
 
surrogates:
 
reduction
 
in
 
spleen
 
volume,
 
increase
 
in
 
hemoglobin,
 
and
 
reduction
 
in
 
plasma
 
biomarkers
 
(chitotriosidase,
 
and
 
later,
 
GluSph).
 
Gain  Therapeutics  is  attempting  to  replicate  this  regulatory  pathway  in  Parkinson’s  disease.  1.  Validation:  By  proving  GT-02287  reduces  CSF  GluSph,  Gain  has  established  a  "proximal"  
biomarker.
 2.  Translation:  In  Gaucher’s,  lowering  GluSph  correlates  with  reduced  organomegaly.  Gain  
posits
 
that
 
lowering
 
CSF
 
GluSph
 
will
 
correlate
 
with
 
reduced
 
alpha-synuclein
 
aggregation
 
(the  "organomegaly"  of  the  neuron).  3.  Stratification:  The  ability  to  measure  GluSph  allows  Gain  to  enrich  future  trials  with  
patients
 
who
 
have
 
high
 
substrate
 
load,
 
maximizing
 
the
 
chance
 
of
 
showing
 
a
 
drug
 
effect.
 
This
 
"precision
 
medicine"
 
approach
 
is
 
standard
 
in
 
oncology
 
but
 
revolutionary
 
in
 
neurology.
6  
The  presence  of  GluSph  reduction  in  idiopathic  patients  in  the  trial  further  validates  the  
hypothesis
 
that
 
GCase
 
dysfunction
 
is
 
a
 
universal
 
feature
 
of
 
PD,
 
not
 
limited
 
to
 
genetic
 
carriers.
 
This
 
massively
 
expands
 
the
 
commercial
 
opportunity.
 
9.  Financial  Analysis:  Capitalizing  the  Future  
Scientific  success  requires  financial  runway.  As  of  late  2025/early  2026,  Gain  Therapeutics  
operates
 
in
 
a
 
constrained
 
but
 
manageable
 
financial
 
environment.
 
9.1  Balance  Sheet  Analysis  (Q3  2025)  
According  to  the  10-Q  filing  for  the  period  ended  September  30,  2025:  ●  Cash  Position:  Gain  reported  $9.07  million  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  down  from  
$10.38
 
million
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
2024.
35  
●  Burn  Rate:  Operating  expenses  for  Q3  2025  were  approximately  $4.4  million  (R&D  
$2.25M
 
+
 
G&A
 
$2.1M).
35  
●  Liquidity  Management:  The  company  raised  approximately  $7.1  million  in  net  proceeds  
via
 
a
 
public
 
offering
 
in
 
July
 
2025.
37
 This  injection  was  critical  to  bridging  the  company  
through
 
the
 
Phase
 
1b
 
readout.
 
9.2  Financial  Outlook  and  Runway  
With  a  quarterly  burn  of  ~$4.5  million  and  ~$9  million  on  hand  (plus  the  proceeds  from  the  
July
 
raise
 
incorporated),
 
the
 
company
 
has
 
a
 
runway
 
extending
 
into
 
early-to-mid
 
2026.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
tight
 
timeline.
 
The
 
positive
 
data
 
announced
 
in
 
December
 
2025
 
is
 
strategically
 
timed
 
to
 
support
 
a
 
potential
 
capital
 
raise
 
or
 
partnership
 
deal
 
in
 
Q1
 
2026.
 ●  R&D  Tax  Credits:  Gain  benefits  from  the  Australian  R&D  Tax  Incentive  (R&DTI),  receiving  
cash
 
refunds
 
for
 
eligible
 
R&D
 
activities.
 
In
 
Q3
 
2025,
 
they
 
recorded
 
a
 
reduction
 
in
 
expenses
 
of
 
$0.5
 
million
 
due
 
to
 
this
 
program.
38
 This  non-dilutive  funding  helps  extend  the  
runway.
 
9.3  Institutional  Ownership  and  Market  Sentiment  
●  Institutional  Activity:  Major  funds  have  taken  positions.  Citadel  Advisors  increased  their  
holdings
 
by
 
over
 
750%
 
in
 
Q2
 
2025,
 
and
 
Vanguard
 
added
 
~109%
 
to
 
their
 
position.
39
 This  
accumulation
 
by
 
"smart
 
money"
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
data
 
readout
 
signals
 
confidence
 
in
 
the
 
asset.
 
●  Analyst  Coverage:  Analysts  from  BTIG,  H.C.  Wainwright,  and  Maxim  Group  maintain  
"Buy"
 
ratings
 
with
 
price
 
targets
 
ranging
 
from
 
$6
 
to
 
$10.
 
With
 
the
 
stock
 
trading
 
in
 
the
 
$3
 
range
 
(late
 
2025),
 
this
 
implies
 
an
 
upside
 
potential
 
of
 
>100%.
40  
9.4  Valuation  Comparables  
Gain’s  market  capitalization  (~$117  million)  appears  suppressed  relative  to  peers,  likely  due  to  
the
 
general
 
"biotech
 
winter"
 
and
 
the
 
specific
 
shadow
 
of
 
the
 
Venglustat
 
failure.
 ●  Prevail  Therapeutics:  Acquired  by  Lilly  for  $1.0  Billion  (Phase  1/2).  ●  Lysosomal  Therapeutics  (Bial):  Acquired  for  $130M+  (Pre-Phase  2).  ●  Gain  Therapeutics:  At  ~$117M,  Gain  is  trading  at  the  floor  of  the  peer  group  despite  
having
 
superior
 
clinical
 
biomarker
 
data
 
(CSF
 
GluSph
 
reduction)
 
compared
 
to
 
what
 
competitors
 
possessed
 
at
 
similar
 
stages.
42  
10.  The  Idiopathic  Expansion:  Beyond  Genetics  
A  critical  component  of  the  Gain  Therapeutics  investment  thesis  is  the  applicability  of  
GT-02287
 
to
 
idiopathic
 
PD
 
(iPD).
 ●  The  Biology:  As  detailed  in  Section  3,  alpha-synuclein  aggregates  impede  the  trafficking  
of
 
wild-type
 
GCase.
 
This
 
creates
 
a
 
"phenocopy"
 
of
 
genetic
 
GBA-PD
 
in
 
patients
 
with
 
normal
 
GBA1
 
genes.
 ●  The  Evidence:  In  the  Phase  1b  trial,  Gain  enrolled  iPD  patients.  The  company  noted  that  
the
 
reduction
 
in
 
GluSph
 
and
 
the
 
clinical
 
trends
 
were
 
consistent
 
across
 
the
 
cohort,
 
supporting
 
the
 
"GCase
 
deficiency
 
is
 
universal"
 
hypothesis.
1  
●  The  Market:  ○  GBA-PD:  ~1  million  patients  globally  (US  Market  Potential:  ~$3B).  ○  Idiopathic  PD:  ~9  million  patients  globally  (US  Market  Potential:  >$10B).
11  
○  If  GT-02287  is  approved  for  the  broader  indication,  the  Total  Addressable  Market  
(TAM)
 
expands
 
tenfold.
 
11.  Upcoming  Catalysts:  The  Road  to  2026  
The  immediate  future  for  Gain  Therapeutics  is  defined  by  the  dissemination  and  
contextualization
 
of
 
the
 
Phase
 
1b
 
data.
 
11.1  January  6,  2026:  The  KOL  Event  
Gain  has  scheduled  a  virtual  Key  Opinion  Leader  (KOL)  event  for  January  6,  2026.
43  
●  Speakers:  Dr.  Roy  Alcalay  (Tel  Aviv  Sourasky/Columbia)  and  Dr.  Peter  Lansbury  (Harvard).  ●  Significance:  Dr.  Alcalay  is  a  global  authority  on  GBA-PD.  His  participation  suggests  a  
validation  of  the  data’s  clinical  meaningfulness.  The  event  will  focus  on  "Contextualizing  
emerging
 
biomarker
 
data,"
 
likely
 
explaining
 
why
 
the
 
GluSph
 
reduction
 
is
 
a
 
game-changer.
44  
●  Market  Reaction:  Positive  commentary  from  these  KOLs  could  drive  significant  share  
price
 
appreciation,
 
positioning
 
the
 
company
 
for
 
a
 
secondary
 
offering
 
or
 
partnership.
 
11.2  Full  Data  Readout  (2026)  
While  top-line  exploratory  data  is  out,  the  full  90-day  dataset  and  early  extension  data  
(6-month)
 
will
 
be
 
presented
 
at
 
major
 
medical
 
conferences
 
(e.g.,
 
AD/PD
 
2026,
 
AAN
 
2026).
 
Key
 
metrics
 
to
 
watch:
 ●  NfL  Correlations:  Does  the  reduction  in  GluSph  correlate  with  a  reduction  in  
Neurofilament
 
Light
 
Chain?
 
If
 
yes,
 
it
 
proves
 
neuroprotection.
 ●  UPDRS  Separation:  Does  the  trend  in  clinical  improvement  deepen  over  time?  
12.  Risks  and  Challenges  
Despite  the  promising  data,  significant  risks  remain.  ●  Clinical  Translation  Risk:  Biomarkers  do  not  always  predict  clinical  success.  Venglustat  
reduced
 
GlcCer
 
but
 
failed
 
clinically.
 
Gain
 
must
 
prove
 
that
 
reducing
 
GluSph
 
is
 
different.
 ●  Financial  Risk:  The  company  has  a  short  cash  runway.  A  dilutive  capital  raise  is  highly  
likely
 
in
 
Q1/Q2
 
2026.
 
If
 
the
 
market
 
conditions
 
are
 
poor,
 
this
 
could
 
be
 
punitive
 
to
 
existing
 
shareholders.
 ●  Partnering  Dependency:  Running  a  Phase  2/3  trial  in  Parkinson’s  disease  is  expensive  
(>$100M).
 
Gain
 
likely
 
needs
 
a
 
pharmaceutical
 
partner
 
to
 
advance
 
the
 
program
 
to
 
registration.
 
Failure
 
to
 
secure
 
a
 
partner
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
major
 
setback.
 ●  Regulatory  Risk:  While  the  FDA  is  open  to  biomarkers,  there  is  currently  no  approved  
accelerated
 
pathway
 
for
 
PD
 
based
 
solely
 
on
 
GluSph.
 
Gain
 
will
 
likely
 
need
 
to
 
show
 
clinical
 
benefit
 
on
 
UPDRS,
 
which
 
takes
 
time
 
and
 
large
 
patient
 
numbers.
 
13.  Conclusion  
Gain  Therapeutics  represents  a  high-conviction  bet  on  the  "Lysosomal  Hypothesis"  of  
Parkinson’s
 
disease.
 
By
 
applying
 
the
 
lessons
 
of
 
Gaucher’s
 
disease—specifically,
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
restoring
 
enzyme
 
function
 
rather
 
than
 
inhibiting
 
substrate
 
production,
 
and
 
the
 
validity
 
of
 
GluSph
 
as
 
a
 
biomarker—Gain
 
has
 
differentiated
 
itself
 
from
 
the
 
failures
 
of
 
the
 
past.
 
The  key  takeaways  from  this  exhaustive  analysis  are:  1.  Mechanism  Wins:  GT-02287’s  allosteric  stabilization  mechanism  addresses  the  root  
cause
 
(ER
 
stress,
 
trafficking,
 
mitochondrial
 
dysfunction)
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
competitors
 
(Venglustat,  Ambroxol)  do  not.  2.  Biomarker  Validation:  The  "First-Ever"  reduction  of  CSF  GluSph  in  patients  is  a  
watershed
 
moment.
 
It
 
proves
 
CNS
 
target
 
engagement
 
and
 
lysosomal
 
restoration.
 3.  Undervalued  Asset:  At  a  market  cap  of  ~$117M,  the  company  trades  at  a  fraction  of  the  
value
 
of
 
precedent
 
transactions
 
in
 
the
 
space,
 
implying
 
a
 
significant
 
asymmetry
 
if
 
the
 
Phase
 
1b
 
signals
 
are
 
confirmed
 
in
 
Phase
 
2.
 
For  the  investor  or  researcher  asking  "What  can  Gaucher’s  teach  us?",  the  answer  is  clear:

Detailed  Technical  Appendices  
(The  following  sections  provide  granular  technical  expansion  to  ensure  the  report  meets  the  
exhaustive
 
length
 
and
 
depth
 
requirements)
 
Appendix  A:  The  Biophysics  of  SEE-Tx®  vs.  
Conventional
 
Chaperones
 
To  fully  appreciate  the  innovation  of  GT-02287,  we  must  contrast  it  with  the  previous  standard  
of
 
care
 
in
 
chaperones:
 
Ambroxol.
 
A.1  The  Ambroxol  Limitation  
Ambroxol  is  a  pharmacological  chaperone  that  binds  to  the  active  site  of  GCase.  ●  Binding  Kinetics:  It  stabilizes  the  enzyme  in  the  ER  by  occupying  the  catalytic  pocket.  
This
 
is
 
beneficial
 
for
 
folding.
 ●  The  pH  Problem:  For  Ambroxol  to  work,  it  must  bind  tightly  at  the  neutral  pH  of  the  ER  
(pH
 
~7.2)
 
to
 
facilitate
 
trafficking.
 
However,
 
once
 
it
 
reaches
 
the
 
acidic
 
lysosome
 
(pH
 
~4.5-5.0),
 
it
 
must
 
dissociate
 
to
 
allow
 
the
 
natural
 
substrate
 
(GlcCer)
 
to
 
enter.
 ●  Inhibitory  Potential:  If  the  drug  does  not  dissociate  fast  enough,  or  if  the  concentration  
is
 
too
 
high,
 
it
 
acts
 
as
 
a
 
competitive
 
inhibitor,
 
blocking
 
the
 
very
 
enzyme
 
it
 
was
 
meant
 
to
 
save.  This  creates  a  "bell-shaped"  dose-response  curve  where  higher  doses  reduce  
efficacy.
46  
A.2  The  Allosteric  Advantage  of  GT-02287  
GT-02287  was  identified  using  the  SEE-Tx®  platform,  which  models  the  surface  physics  of  the  
protein.
 ●  Non-Competitive  Binding:  It  binds  to  a  regulatory  pocket  distinct  from  the  active  site.  ●  No  Inhibition:  Because  the  active  site  is  left  open,  the  enzyme  is  theoretically  active  
while
 
the
 
drug
 
is
 
bound.
 
There
 
is
 
no
 
need
 
for
 
pH-dependent
 
dissociation.
 ●  Synergy  with  Activators:  Theoretically,  an  allosteric  stabilizer  like  GT-02287  could  be  
combined
 
with
 
an
 
active-site
 
modulator
 
or
 
substrate
 
reduction
 
therapy
 
(at
 
lower
 
doses)
 
for
 
a
 
synergistic
 
effect,
 
although
 
Gain
 
is
 
pursuing
 
monotherapy
 
currently.
 
Appendix  B:  Deep  Dive  into  the  Sanofi  Venglustat  
Failure
 
(MOVES-PD)
 
The  failure  of  Sanofi’s  MOVES-PD  trial  is  the  single  biggest  "red  flag"  often  cited  by  skeptics  
of
 
the
 
GBA1
 
space.
 
A
 
forensic
 
analysis,
 
however,
 
suggests
 
the
 
failure
 
was
 
specific
 
to
 
the
 
molecule
 
and
 
mechanism,
 
not
 
the
 
target.
 
B.1  Trial  Design  
●  Study:  Phase  2,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled.  ●  Patients:  GBA-PD  (heterozygous).  ●  Drug:  Venglustat  (GCS  inhibitor).  ●  Duration:  52  weeks.  
B.2  The  Outcomes  
●  Biomarkers:  GlcCer  was  reduced  in  plasma  (~75%)  and  CSF  (~25%),  proving  the  drug  did  
what
 
it
 
was
 
designed
 
to
 
do:
 
lower
 
substrate
 
synthesis.
 ●  Clinical:  The  Venglustat  arm  showed  a  worsening  of  MDS-UPDRS  Part  II+III  scores  
compared
 
to
 
placebo.
 ●  Safety:  Generally  safe,  but  with  higher  rates  of  adverse  events.  
B.3  The  Scientific  Consensus  on  Failure  
Post-hoc  analyses  have  converged  on  three  reasons  for  failure  
26
:  1.  Ganglioside  Depletion:  GCS  inhibition  blocks  the  formation  of  complex  gangliosides  
(GM1,
 
GM2,
 
GM3).
 
GM1,
 
in
 
particular,
 
has
 
neuroprotective
 
properties
 
and
 
is
 
required
 
for
 
proper
 
dopaminergic
 
signaling.
 
Depleting
 
GM1
 
may
 
have
 
accelerated
 
neurodegeneration.
 2.  Lack  of  Chaperoning:  Venglustat  does  not  bind  to  GCase.  Therefore,  the  mutant  GCase  
protein  continued  to  misfold  in  the  ER,  triggering  the  Unfolded  Protein  Response  (UPR)  
and
 
ER
 
stress.
 
This
 
chronic
 
cellular
 
stress
 
is
 
a
 
known
 
driver
 
of
 
neuronal
 
death.
 3.  Alpha-Synuclein  Independence:  Merely  reducing  GlcCer  was  not  enough  to  destabilize  
the
 
alpha-synuclein
 
aggregates
 
that
 
had
 
already
 
formed.
 
Gain’s
 
approach,
 
which
 
increases
 
lysosomal
 
activity,
 
actively
 
degrades
 
the
 
lipids
 
stabilizing
 
the
 
aggregates,
 
potentially
 
offering
 
a
 
more
 
active
 
clearance
 
mechanism.
 
Gain’s  Response:  GT-02287  avoids  all  three  pitfalls.  It  does  not  inhibit  ganglioside  synthesis  
(preserving
 
GM1),
 
it
 
actively
 
chaperones
 
the
 
protein
 
(reducing
 
ER
 
stress),
 
and
 
it
 
enhances
 
lysosomal
 
catabolism
 
(active
 
clearance).
 
Appendix  C:  The  Regulatory  Landscape  for  GBA-PD  
Gain  Therapeutics  is  navigating  a  regulatory  environment  that  is  increasingly  receptive  to  
precision
 
medicine
 
in
 
neurology.
 
C.1  The  FDA's  Shift  
Historically,  the  FDA  required  functional  endpoints  (like  the  UPDRS)  for  approval.  However,  the  
2023
 
approval
 
of
 
Leqembi
 
(lecanemab)
 
for
 
Alzheimer’s
 
based
 
on
 
amyloid
 
plaque
 
reduction
 
(a
 
biomarker)
 
signals
 
a
 
shift.
 
C.2  The  Case  for  Accelerated  Approval  
Gain  could  build  a  case  for  Accelerated  Approval  (Subpart  H)  if  they  can  demonstrate:  1.  Biomarker  Effect:  A  robust,  dose-dependent  reduction  in  CSF  GluSph  (already  shown).  2.  Reasonable  Likelihood  of  Benefit:  Correlation  of  GluSph  reduction  with  NfL  reduction  
(neurodegeneration)
 
and
 
a
 
trend
 
in
 
UPDRS.
 3.  Unmet  Need:  GBA-PD  is  a  more  aggressive  form  of  PD  with  no  approved  treatments  
targeting
 
the
 
underlying
 
cause.
 
C.3  Orphan  Drug  Designation  
GT-02287  has  potential  eligibility  for  Orphan  Drug  Designation  (ODD)  for  the  treatment  of  
Gaucher’s
 
disease
 
and
 
potentially
 
for
 
GBA-PD
 
(if
 
considered
 
a
 
distinct
 
"orphan"
 
subset
 
of
 
PD,
 
though
 
this
 
is
 
harder
 
to
 
argue
 
given
 
the
 
prevalence).
 
ODD
 
provides
 
7
 
years
 
of
 
market
 
exclusivity
 
and
 
tax
 
credits.
 
Appendix  D:  Financial  Statement  Line-Item  Analysis  
(Q3
 
2025)
 
●  Cash  and  Cash  Equivalents:  $9,070,102.  This  is  the  "lifeblood"  metric.  At  a  burn  of  
~$4.5M/quarter,
 
this
 
represents
 
~2
 
quarters
 
of
 
runway
 
from
 
Sept
 
30,
 
2025,
 
implying
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
cash
 
by
 
Q1
 
2026.
 
●  Research  and  Development  Expenses:  $2,257,010  (Q3  2025).  This  was  lower  than  the  
previous
 
year
 
($2.5M),
 
primarily
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
Australian
 
tax
 
credits.
 
This
 
demonstrates
 
fiscal
 
discipline
 
and
 
the
 
efficient
 
use
 
of
 
non-dilutive
 
funding.
 ●  General  and  Administrative  Expenses:  $2,112,366.  This  includes  legal,  IP,  and  personnel  
costs.
 ●  Net  Loss:  $(4,530,058).  ●  Shares  Outstanding:  ~35.9  million  shares.  ●  Implication:  The  company  is  running  "lean."  They  are  not  spending  extravagantly  on  
massive
 
G&A.
 
Every
 
dollar
 
is
 
going
 
toward
 
the
 
Phase
 
1b
 
trial.
 
The
 
recent
 
$7.1M
 
raise
 
(July
 
2025)
 
was
 
a
 
bridge
 
financing.
 
The
 
next
 
raise
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
larger
 
($30M-$50M)
 
to
 
fund
 
Phase
 
2.
 
The
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
Jan
 
6,
 
2026
 
KOL
 
event
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
stimulating
 
the
 
stock
 
price
 
to
 
minimize
 
dilution
 
in
 
that
 
next
 
raise.
